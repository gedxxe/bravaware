## üåê Live Demo

This application is live and can be accessed at:
**[bravaware.vercel.app](https://bravaware.vercel.app)**

## üéØ The Mission

BRAVAWARE aims to democratize early breast cancer detection by providing a powerful, user-friendly tool for medical professionals and researchers. By leveraging deep learning, we offer rapid, accurate, and accessible analysis of ultrasound images, assisting in the crucial tasks of lesion segmentation and classification. Our goal is to support faster, more informed clinical decisions and contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **ü§ñ Interactive AI Analysis:** Upload a breast ultrasound image and receive instant results from our multi-task AI model, including a segmentation mask and a classification prediction (Normal, Benign, or Malignant).
- **üî¨ Advanced Model Architecture:** Explore a detailed, interactive visualization of the U-Net architecture used in the model, complete with scientific explanations for each component.
- **üåê Web-Based & Accessible:** No complex software installation required. The entire tool runs directly in your browser, powered by ONNX Runtime for high-performance inference.
- **Modern & Responsive UI:** A sleek, intuitive, and fully responsive interface built with React and TailwindCSS ensures a seamless experience on any device.
- **SDG-Focused:** Highlighting our commitment to global health and technological advancement for social good.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
